    Does NOT see quiz or timer.

    USER INPUT - onclick, page shows all html with quiz questions. 
                            shows timer,
                            starts timer.

                            How to prevent another click from interferring with counting time?
        JS uses setInterval for a designated time for the quiz.

        Variables Needed:
            10 empty userAnswers declared. assigned later.
                    or one array for the user input?

            10 correct answer Variable
                    or one array if that can work.
        
        an empty variable for score, for total right, and total wrong.

        When user makes selection (is onSelect an event), its answer saved to variable
        if select forms can't be used will use radio buttons and onclick event.

        once user values are stored an Evaluate function needs to be called.

        Evaluate
            if (userVal1 === RightAnswer1 && timeinterval still going) {
                div border of question turns green;
                total score + 10
                number correct ++;
                
            } else (userVal !== RightAnswer1 && time interval stillgoing) {
                div border of question turns red.
                total score stays the same.
                number wrong ++;
            } else ( answer is right or wrong but TIME IS UP) {
                prompt(Sorry Time is up) {
                    change screen to reflect final scores.
                    timer stops or sets to 00:00
                }
            }

            THIS COULD REPEAT FOR EVERY QUESTION.

            OR Evaluate is set up to run a for loop that goes through two arrays (userAnsers and Right Answers and
            compares them)

            IF USER FINISHES BEFORE TIME INTERVAL IS UP
             alert (Great Job on finishing on time!)
             screen shows number right, number wrong, total answered

             maybe also show list of right answers
